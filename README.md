# PHP Movie Watch List

**These files form an interactive movie watch list webpage.**



It uses a mySQL database to store a list of movies.

I did not write any of the files found in the imdbphp folder.  All of those files are from a project on [GitHub](https://github.com/FabianBeiner/PHP-IMDB-Grabber).  This is the code that enables the fetching of info from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).


## Usage

You will need to edit the SQL database info for it to work with your own database.
