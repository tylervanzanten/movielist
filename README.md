# PHP Movie Watch List

**These files form an interactive movie watch list webpage.**


It uses a MySQL database to store a list of movies, and PHP to display them.

I did not write any of the files found in the imdbphp folder.  All of those files are from a project on [GitHub](https://github.com/FabianBeiner/PHP-IMDB-Grabber).  This is the code that enables the fetching of info from [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/).


## Usage

display.php is the file you want to run, and MovieListCMS.php is the file that makes it work.  You will need to edit the SQL database info in display.php for it to work with your own database.
