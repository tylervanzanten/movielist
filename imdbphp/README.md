# PHP IMDb.com Grabber

**This class enables you to retrieve data from IMDb.com with PHP.**

*The script is a proof of concept. It's working pretty well, but you shouldn't use it since IMDb does not allow this method of data grabbing! Personally, I do not use or promote this script. You’re responsible IF you’re using it.*

The technique used is called “[web scraping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping "Web scraping")”. That means: If IMDb changes anything on their HTML, the script is going to fail.

Did you know about the available IMDb.com API? The price to use it is around $15.000. This might be fine for commercial projects, but it's impossible to afford for private/non-commercial ones.

## Changes

5.5.19
- Fixed IMDB_FULL_CAST and IMDB_YEAR.
- getSitesAsUrl() only returns a link, if the url starts with "http".

5.5.18
- The latest pull request I merged broke the caching. Sorry guys, I'll never ever pull a request that easily again.
- Added caching for getFullCast().
- Minor code changes.

5.5.17
- *Heavy* reformating.
- Merged with the changes by *emersonbroga*. (Thanks!)
- Added getFullCast().
- A few smaller fixes.
- Fixed MPAA.

5.5.16
- Typos.

5.5.15
- Fixed IMDB_MPAA. *(Thanks to bla0r)*
- Added possibility to search only for TV shows etc. via IMDB_SEARCHFOR. *(Thanks to bla0r)* (Note: This should be setable via public variable someday ...)

5.5.14
- Fixed IMDB_DIRECTOR.
- Added IMDB_LANG (so you can define which Accept-Language header will be used). *(Thanks to bonk-se.)*
- Fixed IMDB_TITLE_ORIG. *(Thanks to Tamás)*

5.5.13
- Fixed some regular expressions (cast, name, title, year)
- Changed MPAA rating regex - then again, I don't know if this is MPAA or something else. I don't care. :)

5.5.12

- Now checking if there is a valid IMDb id given as search param (this should fix https://github.com/FabianBeiner/PHP-IMDB-Grabber/issues/29)
- Instead of using the URL as cache, now using the ID, as this is always the same.

5.5.11

- `getPoster('big')` is back. *(Thanks to Robert again)*

5.5.10

- Fixed IMDB_RUNTIME.
- Added getSeasonsAsUrl() and reversed the return of getSeasons (starting with Season 1).

5.5.9

- Updated almost every used regex. Gosh, this took me hours …
- `getTitle()` now returns the local movie name if called via `getTitle(true)`. Falls back to global one.
- Tried to fix MPAA rating. Should work, but who knows? ;)
- Removed the `getPoster('big')` parameter as this fails on most of the pictures. So call getPoster() without any parameter.

*(As this is a really heavy update, there will probably be a bunch of mistakes. But give it a try.)*

- Did some code cleaning.
- Optimized local caching system.
- Added a small remote debugging feature.
- Added a trim to every possible return.

## Bugs?
If you run into a problem, feel free to contact me. I will help you if my time allows it. However, support is not guaranteed.

I will only answer bug report if you provide me a detailed output of the failing script – please enable debug through setting "**const IMDB_DEBUG = true;**" in imdb.class.php.

## Wishes?

Well, normally I do not update or fix parts of this script anymore. I do update it, if one of the few givers asks me for an update. But it's very unlikely that I'll add new features for just "anyone". But feel free to add your wish to the project wiki.

## Usage

The usage of this script is simple. Just have a look at imdb.example.php – you will understand easily how it works.
